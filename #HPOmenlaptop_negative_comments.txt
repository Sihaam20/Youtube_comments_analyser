Do you guys have problems with the ethernet ports plastic clip of this laptop Everytime I unplug a cable the clip falls together with it Id doesnt seem to be broken Just bad design (Polarity: -0.5499999999999999)
Oh sory Im very poor  I need dis laptop (Polarity: -0.52)
I am confused  which one should I buy Legion 5i 12gen or this one Legion has 2k screen Does this has screen wobbling issues like HP has (Polarity: -0.4)
How bad is the screen wobbling I expected HP to maintain high quality screen for omen series but disappointed  (Polarity: -0.3474999999999999)
543  2 hours of battery life  Thats terrible If this wasnt a sponsored video Uncle Spurt wouldve ripped them a new one for such poor battery life (Polarity: -0.3159090909090909)
Ugh that amount of flex mushy keyboard mediocre speakers and display lid that flops around like crazy in a 1999 CAD laptop Even with the excellent battery life I would not buy a laptop at that price with such terrible build quality Rather get an Asus which has been killing it lately with the G14 and G15 (Polarity: -0.23333333333333336)
After seeing n hearing the price i successfully wasted my time  (Polarity: -0.2)
I have a similar omen  laptop the INTEL i511400H  Version I HATE the Keyboard num lock randomly activates and deactivates the trackpad is inconsistent and can be unresponsive at times I have installed the latest HP drivers and the issue persists (Polarity: -0.2)
And hp probably wondering why no one loves their omen series Look at that wasted space which is the bezels What an eye sore when it could have had the 1610 aspect ratio yuk (Polarity: -0.2)
I just got this Laptop and I was immediately having trackpad issues It was lagging and the left click wasnt working On vising Hp support website it turns out that its a very common issue and Hp didnt do anything to solve it Im currently returning it before its too late and going for another brand (Polarity: -0.1725)
How is this Omen 15 still working for you Mine worked well for 1 year followed by a plethora of hardware issues also reported by others just outside of the standard warranty period The keyboard and SD reader both failed (Polarity: -0.16666666666666666)
i have poor and old computer (Polarity: -0.15000000000000002)
This is high on my gaming laptop list for a purchase Im going in store this weekend to finally decide If worse comes to worst i return this Omen before the 15 days and get a Lenovo Thank you for the good review (Polarity: -0.10800000000000001)
Hello Arun Sir I am a programmer and i want to buy a laptop few months later What should be my choice  My price range is between 50k to 70k I am preferring for asus tuf a15 on ryzen 5 4600h Please do telland keep trakin (Polarity: -0.1)
mine had a few gamebreaking issues one was throttling the 10750h throttles hard and that translated into clockspeed drop and frame rate plummeting for a second not great when youre playing and also another odd issue was that the heat generated by the cpu and gpu actually damaged the screen right below the task bar horizontal lines formed maybe like 7 to 8 of them after contacting hp they explained it was the heat and wanted me to pay for shipping to RMA it for weeks so they could fix it i just took it back to bestbuy (Polarity: -0.09657738095238096)
Not having a good hinge is a big issue  Playing game is an intense task and usually you might do it in group and little movements that will lead to screen wobbling is really annoying i had this experience with my old viosony  lsptop (Polarity: -0.07968750000000001)
Nah  I bought 5 pieces for the office video card crashes whatever reset or upgrade you try  It crashes 45 times daily with Revit A total failure Ours are all amd ryzen 7 5800 with 6600 m video card and 32 rams Simply Dont buy it  (Polarity: -0.07916666666666668)
Hp omen is so bad I bought the hp omen 17 inch for around 1700 euro two months my laptop is out of warranty and it just brakes down black screen  the motherboard is dead So you know what that means The CPU and gpu are soldered on the board so it will be almost the price of a new one
I use it for like 5hours a week I Almost dont game on it around 10days total
If you count the hours I bin on it it will probably be like around 4 months
Support team is no where to find 
People please save your hard earned money and dont bay this All this YouTube reviews only name the small bad thinks about this product But the most important thing is that the laptops in this price range must be able to get you 5 years of usage for two hours or more 26 months is just not acceptable Before baying this check black screen or hp omen error wont start on google and also there reviews about there costumer service  (Polarity: -0.06213699494949491)
Please hinge will create an issue in long I am using hp omen 15 replace it is hectic part because its connected to keyboard (Polarity: -0.05)
This video baited me pretty hard I got this laptop over a year ago and only 5 months after I got it it started bluscreening like a motherfucker It kept happening even after reinstalling windows It became completely unusable due to how constant the blue screens were and I was never able to repair it (Polarity: -0.03958333333333333)
