Hey bro I have a gaming laptop and my laptop CPU temperatures are hitting 96 Degree Celsius and I am very concerned about it Could you tell me what I can do to bring the temperatures down as they are also causing huge FPS drops and sometimes crashes my game

The FPS in Elden Ring and Assassins Creed Valhalla are very MISLEADING as in the former u showed one of the least demanding areas in the game and in the latter u basically showed the sky

Late to the party but theres a couple of hardware and design issues with this model AMD  RTX2060 
The DP and wireless modules are somehow linked  so if your system goes to sleep with the DP connected the wireless modules stop working and you need a full reboot 

Second the design is just not usable for typing for long periods The edges and the corners are ridiculously sharp Sharp enough to become noticeable very quickly

The keyboard flex is not a big issue in regular usage in all the months Ive had it (Polarity: 0.018333333333333333)

Why buy this when you can get R73060 Omen 15 for 11L instead

You could even get the Zephyrus G15 or Legion 5 Pro or even the Strix G15 both regular  the AMD advantage edition with much better screens and build quality instead (Polarity: 0.05555555555555556)

I like the overall clean and simple design I had an 2019 omen after 1 year i had major overheating issue to the point where i couldnt play anymore then i applied new thermal paste and it helped a lot but still it would overheat from time to time depending on outside temps After 3 years it suddenly shut down one day and i couldnt turn it on anymore from frustration i viscously opened the case and tried to fix it somehow but failed miserbly and destroyed the whole thinganyway ive learned that proper cooling is like almost the most important factor when u gonna buy a gaming laptop (Polarity: 0.0776903651903652)

hey Matt I just got my asus zenbook pro 16x OLED i9 a few days ago and you NEED to do a full review on this thing I think its the future of the perfect laptop for a content creator who also likes to game a bit or just really dislikes mac once the next gen comes out and they take away this 60 hz screen then there is nothing I can complain about on this laptop its extremely quit and versatile only future upgraded needed is a 120hz panel while keeping the same color accuracy and maybe an option to go over a rtx3060 but anyway hope you review it I really think youll enjoy it (Polarity: 0.1096153846153846)
