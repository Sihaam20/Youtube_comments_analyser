I opted for a MSI vector GP66 which has a 12700h I7 and 3070ti 150w  16gb DDR5 memory and the best performing laptop besting the Acer predator as well 165hz screen with 1440p res this purchase was made 6 months ago and if anyone is considering a 3070ti laptop I would say blindly go for vector gp66 the same model I have it has the best gaming performance thermals are amazing and its much better than the predator and a perfect desktop replacement in my opinion plus it has a steelseries keyboard and mux switch that can extract the full gpu potential without needing an external monitor (Polarity: 0.395)

Always I have observed how most gaming laptops with good battery life have AMD 6000 series CPUs in them Intel does get better performancewise at higher power especially But its better to have more thermal and power budget being available to the GPU and lastly AMD has a good integrated GPUs that can save you a lot of battery where absolute GPU power isnt a priority (Polarity: 0.38636363636363635)

Just had the 17 with the i73070 to replace my desktop 3070 energy prices are a joke so makes sense for long sessions Have to say Im very impressed its obviously less powerful than the desktop 3070 master Ive got But the drop from 4K gaming to 1440p has been great thanks to the 173in IPS panel it comes with Performance is also stellar on pretty much every title Ive tried
Would highly recommend  (Polarity: 0.2943333333333334)
Recently got this laptop though a newer model with the Ryzen 5600H and an RTX 3060 on sale for 900 through HPs website 
About a week in now and absolutely loving it Basically everything stated in this review holds true for my newer model 
Only pulled the trigger cus Id been needing a new laptop for years now and the deal just seemed too good to ignore but Im feeling zero regret so far 
HP really did a great job on the Omen 15 Would definitely recommend (Polarity: 0.2886363636363637)

I have the 2021 Omen 16  RTX 3070R7 5800H  Picked it on discount I had the Legion 5 17 first  but returned it and kept this one Why many ask Here is why I chose this over the Legion 

The Screen Less backlight bleeding I hate bleeding on IPS displays
Keyboard Although its mushy its still far better than the one on the Legion for my taste 
Speakers The speakers are loud and clear  not much bass but on the Legion the sound was like the laptop was submerged under water
Powerbrick This one is a sexy little thing The legion had an actual chinese brick at twice the size and weight
Design This looks like a normal laptop not a gamer laptop This one I can use at the coffieshop without feeling like a sweaty teenager 
The trackpad The size and feel is good not macbook good but good On the legion it felt like i was back on windows 98
Batterylife about twice the batterylife than on the Legion
Cooling With a custom fan curve this thing is almost zero db at idle and with gaming its just good Good cooling and does neither get warm or throttle

Reasons to pick the Legion More watt rtx 3070 and mux switch if thats not the most important thing for you  This is the king of budget gaming laptops

So if you can find a Omen 16 2021 on a heavy discount you can make yourself a good deal (Polarity: 0.2785493827160494)

Bought the 2021 Omen 15 recently for 1200 CAD same config as showcased here except with a 5600H no complaints so far for the price My screen doesnt wobble and opens with one hand if anything I wish there was a groove at the front to ease opening I love the chin that allows the screen to sit higher I always prop up the back end of the laptop so that the screen sits at eye level I also never notice any fingerprints neither on the brushed plastic top nor the keyboard deck You people need to wash your hands more often lol BUT the speakers are just okay and for Gods sake enough with the 720p webcam I like the huge trackpad since I have big hands but lets be honest nobodys using a gaming laptop without a proper mouse (Polarity: 0.259375)
Good video do you know if by 2023 there will be some changes in the HP OMEN 16 in the chassis apart from the new gpu and cpu HP OMEN should release an OMEN 14 to compete with the Asus g14 Alienware 14 that seems beautiful but very expensive and the Razer 14 greetings (Polarity: 0.25909090909090904)

I wont recommend omen as I own this device and there is an heatsink issue first 2 years it runs nice and after the start of 2nd year it starts to overheat even in the basic day to day use It idles around 75 in 4 chrome tabs discord and visual studio Not talking about the gaming valorant not so intensive game u get around 96 to 100 and in intensive games like warzone u can run peacefully for 15 minutes after that it crashes

Ive been struggling for several months to find a laptop on par with the new m1 pro macbooks The battery life performance and build quality Its fantastic I just dont like using mac OS There doesnt appear to be any other laptop that can match it The only one Ive found that was marginally close was the dell xps line but even that has thermal issues and sub par build quality Dont suppose you have come across anything that would be a good match but for mac os haters (Polarity: 0.1852272727272727)
Ive had my Omen 15 for just over 6 months and I can safely say its one of the best laptops ive ever come across I mainly bought it for editing on adobe and producing music on ableton and pro tools Its perfect for this and having played a range of games from Warzone Minecraft Osiris The Forrest and many other RPGS its perfect graphics and has never been laggy or buggy Aside from using and external hard drive for those bigger games mine has 2gb ram storage Ive got no complains in terms of storage

The only minor hiccoughs that I have is that its very sharp in terms of build The corners on either side of the mouse pad can get annoying at times especially when typing out long essays and word documents as a student but that is something you get used to very quickly The new Omen lighting beta version is a really cool asthetic feature that you can customise to any colour aven changing the colours in an ambient setting 

Another little hiccough that I have is that the battery runs out fairly quickly which means that its a bit annoying when editing and gaming where it has to be plugged in otherwise it runs out of juice too quickly 

Aside from that its an incredibly good purchase and one that I believe ill be using for a fair few years 

LMK if you have any other questions about it Happy to help out if youre deciding to buy one (Polarity: 0.1607366771159875)

I bought this laptop 2 months ago with the specs AMD Ryzen 9 59000 with Radeon Graphics RTX 3070 8GB 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD As for my experience this laptop does the work better than those what is currently on the market Im an Interior Architect by profession and this thing is a beast i guarantee you working with AutoCAD Fusion and CPUGPU intensive softwares This beast does the job the best out of all the gaming laptops i handled for the last 4 years Im also a casual gamer  for Forza horizon 5 Elden Ring and Assasins Creed the fps doesnt dip to around 100 or 95fps with Ultra Settings or Extreme Laptop temperature may vary depending on the ambient temperature of your room or office but as per my experience i work here in Saudi Arabia and the temperature here of the environment is ambient 37degree to 45degree and this thing is not going above 70degrees with its full performance So all in all if you want to purchase this laptop i recommend you should (Polarity: 0.15312499999999998)
I have to 2020 Omen 15 and its a decent laptop that I use as a blend of gaming and official school work I have been using this as my daily driver for almost 2 years  Some of the benefits of the old version I got was the ridiculous 300hz display although its equipped with an rtx2060 and intel i7 10th gen chip Yet the older model has a single USBc  it supports thunderbolt Otherwise the edges are quite sharp like sharp enough to almost cut you and the bottom housing is very easy to crack so if possible I would recommend getting an additional back plate If care about the cosmetic look Also the feet come off very easily because they have no adhesive they are just heat shrunk on there But if you find a good outofbox deal they will last a very long time with some cosmetic damage but are worth it I bought mine for around 950 and today if you check today they cost anywhere from 900 to 1000 in good condition (Polarity: 0.14112433862433862)
For that price im not buying a laptop made in plastic thats just low quality Overall I dont buy laptops made out of plastic it just feels cheap Except if you want to buy a super budget laptop when I bought my first student laptop  it was all in plastic and I bought it for 400 dollars it worked fine for me for a couple of years just heavy to carry But thats all I could afford But if you have the money dont spend it on plastic computers it just feels cheap and not good to use (Polarity: 0.1388888888888889)
So Im an engineering student looking at laptops and the Omen 16 has really grabbed my attention Im almost ready to splurge and finally buy it but I have a pretty big concern that Ive seemed to notice looking at reviews I got to look at one in person and when I turned it on in the store and went to open Google the fans instantly turned on It wasnt too loud but that surprised me a little as I was only using Google I looked online and this seems to be a other people have Is there a way to turn the fans off for more tame use like browsing the internet Or is there a way to make them more quiet If anyone can help me out that would be great  (Polarity: 0.12475490196078433)

Im honestly disappointed in this years on omen brand and a lot has been reduced from the previous version  build quality is very good especially the one released in 2019 Im still using the Omen laptop released in 2018 and this laptop is really good for longterm use so far there have never been any problems except changing the battery every 25 y and I replaced the thermal for 2 years once and the temperature never overheated I hope omen returns to its heyday back in 20172020 (Polarity: 0.11333333333333331)
I have an HP omen 16 2021 i7 RTX3050 Almost a year into buying the laptop I get at the max 2 hours of backup now earlier it was 4 hours how is it that there is so much difference Performance is excellent but really disappointed with the battery backup I still do not understand how youre getting 9 hours (Polarity: 0.11249999999999999)
Dont worry about the flex when the lid is closed I throw this laptop in my backpack stuffed full of clothes with a Nintendo Switch Barley get my laptop in there and I have had no problems with the screen whatsoever The aluminum body is very well built I love this laptop but my only complaint is that the speakers are too quiet I also had audio issues with it and am replacing the speakers I thought that Bang  Olufsen would sound so much better but its seriously way too quiet for my taste (Polarity: 0.1106060606060606)
hey Brother thank you making such amazing insightful videos I needed a little bit of your expertise to confirm a hunch I had bought  HP OMEN 16 with Intel i7 12700H and RTX 3070ti 8GB VRAM with 16GB DDR5 RAM and 1GB NVME SSD PCI 4th Gen and it is giving me only 3 hours of battery life even if I just use it for normal browsing and daily tasks 
My friend has a HP Omen 16 with Ryzen 76800H RTX 3060 6GB VRAM 16GB DDR5 RAM 1GB NVME SSD PCI 4th Gen but he is getting 67 hours of battery for normal usage
Can you please help me and tell me does my i7 model defective and I should replace it or in i7 3 hours is actually the maximum battery that i can expect (Polarity: 0.08906250000000002)

Good review
I am very late but i think that your statement might be incorrect i might be wrong
To my knowledge the problem of laptops overheating started when the companys started battling for the thinnest form factor
As you know that means compromising somewhere
Which is thermals
The laptops used to be way bulkier they had the room to do stuff like thermals beter on the fact alone that the insides had more space (Polarity: 0.07749999999999999)
Feels like the vbios of the gpu aint that good my Legion 3070 always boosts dynamic and is constant at 145150w for any game I play (Polarity: 0.07499999999999998)
Great and accurate review I bought the Intel version of this two days ago The soft and wobbly screen was the first thing I noticed and I dislike it Performance is a beast and I actually love the basic black slab styling vs tacky Gamer aesthetics The bad webcam and the speakers oh lord theyre bad The Bang and Olufsen label means nothing I want to like it but ultimately Im returning it tomorrow  HP was SO close on getting this right (Polarity: 0.06991341991341994)
