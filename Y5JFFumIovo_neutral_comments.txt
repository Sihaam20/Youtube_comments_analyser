So Ben this can take more than 16GB RAM  HP Australia told me maximum 16GB  I picked up the Ryzen 5 5600H hexa core CPU16GB RAM256GB nvme drivenvidia GTX 1650 variant earlier tonight  It seems like it currently has 2 x 8GB sticks in it but down the track Id like to bump it to 32GB RAM 2 x 16GB  Will add a 2TB SSD 25 drive later on down the track too in the spare bay  

Can you confirm that RAM is definitely expandable above 16GB  None of the HP documentation on the Australian HP website even touches on this user manual and service manual  HPs website sucks lol (Polarity: 0.06262626262626263)
