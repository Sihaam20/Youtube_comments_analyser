Hey are the built quality of the hp gaming laptops better than the nitro5 I have had bad exerience with nongaming acer laptops in the past (Polarity: -0.14999999999999994)
I ordered this laptop on Sept 22 and the emailed summery claimed it would take a little over a week to be delivered
It finally arrived today Nov 5th
I dont know if it has to do the current political issues involving china where my order was assembled at this time lateAutumn 2021 but I was quite unsatisfied with the international portion of the delivery
The customer support company that handled the call was very unprofessional and rude about my questions
I was set back and forth between the wrong departments several times with obvious laughter in the background concerning my call
There was even an effort made on the customer service end to make sure it had the wrong address in my town
It was relabeled with a false address under my name printed by fedx under instruction from the customer service company
Fortunately I know the only fedx delivery driver who runs our route so it made it to my home (Polarity: -0.04921875)
