Got myself the ryzen 7 5800 h with rtx 3050 version the keypad wobble is somehow non existent on mine Planning on upgrading the ram to 64 gigs and adding a 2 tb or larger ssd Overall a great laptop The display is nice and responsive if you dont mind the lack of colour correctness (Polarity: 0.35)

Great  overview Except for the green  backlit keyboard I like this model as its very similar to the HP Omen I currently own (Polarity: 0.30000000000000004)
Great review but Im curious how long the battery life is (Polarity: 0.21666666666666667)
I have the HP Pavilion GL with the I5 and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 and I love it 

Its an amazing emulation laptop Can emulate anything even PS3 at max settings without any problems at all

Thats all I use for though absolutely nothing else



Maybe I will upgrade next year if theres something like this next black friday But I doubt I need it (Polarity: 0.18888888888888888)
if we update ram and hard disk to ssd it will work smoothly (Polarity: 0.05416666666666667)
